    <h1>A short excerpt from Jeremy Keith's Resilient web design</h1>
    <p>
      The history of human civilisation is a tale of cumulative effort. Each
      generation builds upon the work of their forebears. Sometimes the work
      takes a backward step. Sometimes we wander down dead ends. But we struggle
      on. Bit by bit our species makes progress. Whether the progress is
      incremental or a huge leap forward, it is always borne upon the
      accomplishments of those who came before us.
