    <h1>A second excerpt from Jeremy Keith's Resilient web design Updated</h1>
    <p>
      The layout of the QWERTY keyboard for your computer—and its software
      equivalent on your phone—is an echo of the design of the first generation
      of typewriters. That arrangement of keys was chosen to reduce the chances
      of mechanical pieces of metal clashing as they sprang forward to leave
      their mark on the paper.
